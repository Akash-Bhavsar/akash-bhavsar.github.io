    - title: Application Security Engineer
      institution: Sydney Tools PTY LTD
      location: Sydney, Australia
      year: 11/2023 - Present
      description:
        - Methodically identify, exploit, and document security vulnerabilities in business-critical web applications and APIs, utilizing tools like Burp Suite and Metasploit to mitigate OWASP Top 10 threats.
        - Spearheaded the secure code review process, conducting rigorous Pull Request (PR) reviews to enforce secure coding standards. Acted as the final quality gatekeeper to prevent vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS) from reaching production.
        - Orchestrated secure CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, designing custom workflows that automate security testing (SAST/DAST) and streamline deployment, ensuring rapid yet secure delivery cycles.
        - Fortified cloud infrastructure by implementing best practices for AWS and GCP environments. Hardened Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters to minimize the attack surface and ensure robust runtime protection.
        - Managed and mentored a team of developers and interns, overseeing daily operations. Led the end-to-end recruitment process by conducting technical interviews and hiring new talent, fostering a high-performance engineering culture.
        - Designed and delivered comprehensive training programs for new employees and interns, focusing on secure coding principles and operational best practices to reduce vulnerability introduction rates.
        - Architected secure network layers by configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy and managing SSL/TLS certificate lifecycles, ensuring encrypted communication and defense against Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
        - Acted as the primary point of contact for security incidents, analyzing alerts and executing rapid triage and escalation procedures to maintain operational resilience and minimize business impact.
