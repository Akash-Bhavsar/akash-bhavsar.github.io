## Hi, I'm Akash Bhavsar 👋

I'm an **Application Security Consultant & Penetration Tester (OSCP+)** with a passion for breaking things to make them more secure. My work focuses on identifying vulnerabilities before attackers do, and helping development teams build security into their applications from the ground up.

### What I Do

- **Penetration Testing** — Web applications, APIs, mobile apps, and cloud infrastructure
- **Secure Code Review** — Finding security flaws in source code across multiple languages
- **API Security** — Assessing authentication, authorization, and data exposure risks
- **Cloud Security** — AWS/Azure/GCP security assessments and misconfigurations
- **Security Architecture** — Threat modeling and secure design reviews

### My Approach

I believe in **offensive security with a defensive mindset**. Every vulnerability I find comes with actionable remediation guidance that developers can actually implement. Security shouldn't be a blocker—it should be an enabler.

### Certifications & Skills

- **OSCP+** (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
- OWASP Top 10, API Security Top 10
- Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nuclei, Nmap
- Python, JavaScript, Bash scripting
- CI/CD Security, DevSecOps practices
