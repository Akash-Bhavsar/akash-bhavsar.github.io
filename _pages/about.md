I'm an **OSCP+ certified Application Security Engineer** with **8+ years of experience** spanning full-stack development, penetration testing, and DevSecOps. Currently at **Sydney Tools**, I identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in business-critical applications while leading secure development practices across the engineering team.

My journey from **Senior Full Stack Developer to Security Engineer** gives me a unique perspective—I understand how developers think, which makes me effective at both finding vulnerabilities and providing practical remediation guidance.

## 🎯 What I Do

**Offensive Security**
- Web Application & API Penetration Testing (Burp Suite Pro, Metasploit, SQLMap, Nuclei, Nikto, Wfuzz, Postman, Caido)
- Active Directory Attacks & Privilege Escalation (BloodHound, Mimikatz, Rubeus, Impacket, CrackMapExec, Evil-WinRM)
- Windows & Linux Exploitation (Nmap, Rustscan, Gobuster, ffuf, Hashcat, John the Ripper, Hydra, LinPEAS, WinPEAS)
- CVE Research & Exploitation (Hack The Box practitioner)

**Security Engineering**
- Led secure code review initiatives as the final security gatekeeper, preventing SQLi, XSS, and IDOR vulnerabilities from reaching production (Semgrep, CodeQL, Bandit, ESLint Security, Brakeman, SpotBugs, Checkmarx)
- Architected DevSecOps pipelines integrating SAST/DAST tools (Snyk, SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Trivy, Checkov, Gitleaks, TruffleHog) into GitHub Actions workflows
- Hardened cloud environments across AWS & GCP—secured IAM policies, container runtimes, and Kubernetes RBAC (ScoutSuite, Prowler, Falco, kube-bench)
- Designed security architectures for microservices, implementing OAuth2/OIDC flows and secrets management with HashiCorp Vault

**Development Background** *(What makes me effective at AppSec)*
- 5+ years building production systems in Python, Node.js, React, Vue.js, and Next.js—I know where developers cut corners
- Orchestrated cloud-native infrastructure with Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD (Jenkins, Buildkite, GitHub Actions)
- Designed high-availability database schemas (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and secure API patterns (REST, GraphQL) with monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk)

- **OSCP+ Certified** — [Verify Credential](https://credentials.offsec.com/9ceba917-605a-40df-80cd-a29f00d3bb74) (Issued Dec 2025, Expires Dec 2028)
- **Hack The Box** — [View Profile](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/2430357) | Active practitioner (Era, Mirage, Outbound, Faraday, Voleur, Sorcery)
- **Security Leader** — Mentor developers, conduct security training, lead incident response
- **Full-Stack to Security** — Unique perspective bridging development and security

## 💡 My Approach

I don't just find vulnerabilities—I **understand the developer mindset** and provide **actionable remediation guidance**. Having built production systems myself, I know what's realistic to fix and how to prioritize security work alongside feature development.

> *"Security isn't about saying no—it's about finding ways to say yes, securely."*
